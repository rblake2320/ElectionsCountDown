## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Testing Methodology
- **Don't just check presence** - Verify data accuracy
- **Cross-check with facts** - 1043 members is wrong (should be 535)
- **Investigate root causes** - Script run twice caused duplicates
- **Test end-to-end** - Database → API → Frontend

### Development Practices
- **Use proper table names** - `candidateProfiles` not `candidateBiography`
- **Add conflict handling** - `.onConflictDoNothing()` prevents duplicates
- **Document data sources** - Track where data comes from
- **Version control everything** - All fixes committed to Git

### Platform Architecture
- **Separate concerns** - Service layer for external APIs
- **Transform data** - API format ≠ Frontend format
- **Verify assumptions** - Check actual database, not just schema
- **Create verification tools** - Scripts to check data integrity
