# Database Population Master Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to populate ALL database tables that should have data from external sources.

## üìä Table Classification

| Table | Source | Script | Priority |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| **elections** | Google Civic API, Ballotpedia | Already populated | HIGH |
| **candidates** | Google Civic API, FEC | Already populated | HIGH |
| **candidate_profiles** | Research, Ballotpedia | `populate_all_tables.ts` | HIGH |
| **candidate_positions** | Vote Smart, Campaign sites | `populate_all_tables.ts` | HIGH |

| **campaign_accounts** | Campaign API accounts - empty until campaigns register |
| **campaign_content** | Campaign-created content - empty until campaigns post |
| **voter_interactions** | User engagement tracking - accumulates as users interact |
| **real_time_polling** | Platform analytics - accumulates from user interactions |
| **users** | User accounts - empty until users register |
| **watchlist** | User watchlists - empty until users add elections |

## üöÄ Execution Order (In Replit)

### Step 1: Analyze Current State

```bash
npx tsx analyze_all_tables.ts
```

This will show you which tables are empty and which should have data.

### Step 2: Populate Candidate Data

```bash
npx tsx populate_all_tables.ts
```

**Populates:**
- 6 candidate profiles (Detroit & Nashville mayors)
- 29 policy positions
- 11 data source attributions

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úì Inserted profile for James E. Craig
‚úì Inserted profile for Mary Sheffield
‚úì Inserted profile for Michael Edward Duggan
‚úì Inserted profile for Saunteel Jenkins
‚úì Inserted profile for Freddie O'Connell
‚úì Inserted profile for David Briley
‚úì Inserted 29 policy positions
‚úì Inserted 11 data sources
```

### Step 3: Populate Congressional Data

```bash
npx tsx populate_congress_and_cycles.ts
```

**Populates:**
- Congress members (from JSON file - ~528 members)
- 15 congressional bills (119th Congress)
- 15 congressional committees (House & Senate)
- 3 election cycles (2024, 2025, 2026)

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úì Inserted 528 congressional members
‚úì Inserted 15 congressional bills
‚úì Inserted 15 congressional committees
‚úì Inserted 3 election cycles
```

### Step 4: Verify Completion

```bash
npx tsx analyze_all_tables.ts
```

Check that all high-priority tables now have data.

## üìã Detailed Script Descriptions

### 1. `analyze_all_tables.ts`

**Purpose:** Analyze all database tables and identify which should have data

**Features:**
- Categorizes tables by priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/N/A)
- Shows current row counts
- Identifies data sources for each table
- Calculates completion percentage
- Distinguishes between external data and user-generated content

**When to Run:**
- Before populating data (to see what's missing)
- After populating data (to verify success)
- Anytime you want to check database status

### 2. `populate_all_tables.ts`

**Purpose:** Populate candidate profiles, positions, and data sources

**Data Included:**
- **6 Candidate Profiles:**
  - James Craig (Detroit, Republican)
  - Mary Sheffield (Detroit, Democratic)
  - Mike Duggan (Detroit, Democratic, Incumbent)
  - Saunteel Jenkins (Detroit, Democratic)

  - Transportation

- **11 Data Sources:**
  - Ballotpedia
  - Wikipedia
  - Official government websites
  - Campaign websites
  - City records

**Safety Features:**
- Idempotent (can run multiple times)
- Uses `onConflictDoNothing()` to prevent duplicates
- Error handling for individual inserts
- Verification of row counts

### 3. `populate_congress_and_cycles.ts`

**Purpose:** Populate congressional data and election cycles

**Data Included:**
- **Congress Members:**
  - Reads from `./attached_assets/congress_members_complete.json`
  - ~528 members of 119th Congress (2025-2026)
  - Both House and Senate members

## üß™ Testing

### Test Candidate Modal Popups
1. Go to platform URL
2. Navigate to Detroit or Nashville mayoral elections
3. Click on candidate names
4. Verify modal displays:
   - Biography
   - Education
   - Professional background
   - Policy positions
   - Data sources

### Test Congress Section
1. Navigate to Congress section
2. Verify 528 members are displayed
3. Check that bills and committees are accessible
4. Verify member details load correctly

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Script fails with "DATABASE_URL must be set"
**Solution:** Must run in Replit environment where DATABASE_URL is configured

### Congress members not populating
**Solution:** Ensure `./attached_assets/congress_members_complete.json` file exists

### Candidate IDs don't match
**Solution:** Verify candidate IDs (292-295, 300, 302) exist in candidates table

### Modal popups still empty
**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify data with: `SELECT * FROM candidate_profiles;`

## üìà Future Enhancements

### To Complete All 179 Candidates
1. Use `populate_all_tables.ts` as template
2. Research remaining candidates
3. Follow established data structure
4. Run script with expanded data

### To Add Election Results
1. Create `populate_election_results.ts`
2. Fetch historical data from state election offices
3. Populate for past elections only

### To Integrate Live APIs
1. Set up ProPublica Congress API key
2. Create automated sync scripts
3. Schedule regular updates

## üìû Support

### Common Issues

**Q: Can I run scripts multiple times?**
A: Yes! All scripts use `onConflictDoNothing()` to prevent duplicates.

**Q: What if I only want to populate some tables?**
A: Run individual scripts as needed. They're independent.

**Q: How do I update existing data?**
A: Modify the script data and re-run. Conflicts will be ignored, so you may need to delete old data first.

**Q: Where do I get more congressional data?**
A: Use congress.gov API or ProPublica Congress API with proper API keys.
