## üìä Executive Summary

The Election Countdown Platform is **partially functional** with several critical issues preventing full user experience. The platform shows **564 of 604 elections** and has **1,043 congressional members** loaded successfully. However, critical features like local election filtering, candidate detail modals, and location-based search are currently broken.

### Overall Platform Health: üü° **65% Functional**

**Working Features:**
- ‚úÖ Elections list display (564/604 elections)
- ‚úÖ Congress section (1,043 members)
- ‚úÖ Navigation and basic UI
- ‚úÖ Countdown timers
- ‚úÖ Filter interface (UI only)

**Broken Features:**
- ‚ùå Local elections filter (0 results)
- ‚ùå Location-based election search
- ‚ùå Candidate detail modals
- ‚ùå API endpoint for candidate details
- ‚ùå External API services (ProPublica, VoteSmart)

## üö® Critical Issues Found

### Issue #1: External API Services Down üî¥ CRITICAL
**Status:** 2 critical services unavailable

**Services Affected:**
- **ProPublica*** - Marked as critical for core functionality
- **VoteSmart*** - Marked as critical for core functionality

**Non-Critical Services Down:**
- OpenStates (‚ö†Ô∏è Warning)
- Perplexity (‚ö†Ô∏è Warning)
- Freecrawl (‚ö†Ô∏è Warning)
- US Census (‚ö†Ô∏è Warning)

**Impact:** Platform cannot fetch real-time data from external sources, limiting candidate information and legislative tracking.

**Solution:** 
1. Check API keys and credentials
2. Verify API endpoint URLs
3. Implement fallback to local database
4. Consider alternative data sources

**Priority:** üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Affects core functionality

---

### Issue #2: Local Elections Filter Broken üî¥ HIGH
**Status:** Shows 0 of 604 elections when "Local" filter applied

**Root Cause:** Elections are not properly categorized with `level: 'local'` in the database. Mayoral elections (Detroit, Nashville) exist but lack proper categorization.

**Test Results:**
- Applied "Local" filter ‚Üí "0 of 604 elections"
- Message: "No Elections Found"
- Detroit and Nashville mayoral races not appearing

**Impact:** Users cannot discover local elections through the primary navigation method. This affects the candidates we populated data for (Mary Sheffield, Saunteel Jenkins, Freddie O'Connell, David Briley).

**Solution:** Run `fix-election-levels.ts` script in Replit:
```bash
npx tsx fix-election-levels.ts
```

**Priority:** üî¥ **HIGH** - Critical for user experience

---

### Issue #3: Location-Based Election Search Broken üî¥ HIGH
**Status:** Returns 0 results for valid locations

**Test Case:** Searched for "Nashville, TN"

**Results:**
- Location: Nashville, TN ‚úÖ (recognized)
- Local Elections Found: 0 ‚ùå
- Total State Elections: 0 ‚ùå
- Message: "No local elections found for Nashville"

**Root Cause:** Same as Issue #2 - elections not categorized as `level: 'local'`

**Impact:** Users cannot find elections by entering their city/location, which is a primary use case for the platform.

**Solution:** Same as Issue #2 - run `fix-election-levels.ts`

**Priority:** üî¥ **HIGH** - Critical for user experience

---

### Issue #4: Candidate Details API Broken üî¥ CRITICAL
**Status:** API returns "Invalid candidate ID" error

**Test Cases:**
- Candidate ID 300 (Freddie O'Connell): `{"error":"Invalid candidate ID"}`
- Candidate ID 293 (Mary Sheffield): `{"error":"Invalid candidate ID"}`

**Root Cause:** 
1. Live server running OLD code (hasn't pulled git changes)
2. OR candidate IDs don't match database records
3. OR database doesn't have populated data yet

**Impact:** Candidate modals cannot display detailed information. Users cannot see biographies, policy positions, or other candidate details.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Populate candidate data
npx tsx populate_all_tables.ts

# Verify data exists
npx tsx verify-database.ts

# Test API
npx tsx test-api-endpoint.ts
```

**Priority:** üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Blocks main feature we're trying to fix
