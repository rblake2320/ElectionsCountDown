- David Briley (ID: 302) - No data
- Freddie O'Connell (ID: 300) - No data
- Matt Wiltshire (ID: 303) - No data

**Result:** ‚ùå FAILED - API returns empty data for all candidates

---

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

### Issue #1: Code Not Deployed
The server is still running OLD code that hasn't been updated with our fixes:
- API endpoint still queries wrong tables or doesn't have the fix
- `git pull origin main` has NOT been executed in Replit

### Issue #2: Database Not Populated
The population scripts have NOT been executed:
- `populate_all_tables.ts` - Not run
- `populate_congress_and_cycles.ts` - Not run
- `populate_polling_data.ts` - Not run

### Issue #3: External API Dependency
The platform is trying to use VoteSmart API (which is unavailable) instead of local database:
- Error message: "VoteSmart API key not configured"
- Should fall back to local database, but isn't

**Conclusion:** The fixes we created are in GitHub but NOT deployed to the live server. The database is empty and the API is not using local data.

## TEST #4: Elections Page Navigation ‚ùå

**Status:** FAILED

### Test Action:
Navigated to `/elections` page

### Result:
- ‚ùå **"Page Not Found"** error displayed
- Error message: "The page you're looking for doesn't exist or may have been moved."

### Suggestions Shown:
- Check the URL for typos
- Go back to previous page
- Return to elections dashboard

**Result:** ‚ùå FAILED - Elections page is broken or route not configured properly

**Note:** This is a NEW issue not identified in previous diagnostics. The `/elections` route appears to be broken.

---



## TEST #5: Local Elections Filter Functionality ‚ùå

**Status:** FAILED - CRITICAL ISSUE CONFIRMED

### Test Action:
Applied "Level: Local" filter from Government Level section

### Result:
- ‚ùå **"Showing 0 of 612 elections"**
- ‚ùå **"No Elections Found"** message displayed
- Message: "Try adjusting your filters or search criteria to find elections."

### Filter Badge Shown:
- "Level: Local" with X button to clear

### Expected Behavior:
Should show 50+ local elections including:
- Nashville Mayoral Election
- Detroit Mayoral Election
- Other city/county elections

### Actual Behavior:
Shows 0 elections - completely broken

**Root Cause:** Elections in database are not properly categorized with `level: 'local'`. The Nashville and Detroit mayoral elections exist but don't have the correct level designation.

**Result:** ‚ùå FAILED - Local filter is completely non-functional

**Impact:** HIGH - Users cannot discover local elections through filtering, which is a core platform feature.

## TEST #6: Congress Section - Members Tab ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Status:** WORKING but DATA ACCURACY ISSUE

### Members Tab:
- ‚úÖ Shows "1043 of 1043 members"
- ‚úÖ Lists congressional members with names, parties, states, districts
- ‚úÖ Filter functionality present
- ‚úÖ Search functionality present

### Data Accuracy Issue:
- ‚ùå **Shows 1043 members but U.S. Congress only has 535 members (100 Senate + 435 House)**
- **This is nearly DOUBLE the correct number!**

**Possible causes:**
1. Duplicate entries in database
2. Historical members mixed with current members
3. Multiple congressional sessions included
4. Data quality/cleanup issue

**Verification needed:** Check if database has duplicate or historical members that should be filtered out.

---

## TEST #7: Congress Section - Bills Tab ‚úÖ

**Status:** WORKING - Has Real Data

### Bills Tab:
- ‚úÖ Shows "Recent Bills" section
- ‚úÖ Has real congressional bills:
  - "Trafficking Survivors Relief Act" (2025-10-17, Calendar No. 299)
  - "Count the Crimes to Cut Act" (2025-10-17, Calendar No. 298)
- ‚úÖ "Bills by Congress" filter showing "119" and "Current (119th)"
- ‚úÖ Filter by status functionality
- ‚úÖ Search functionality

### Data Accuracy:
- ‚úÖ **119th Congress is CORRECT** - The current Congress (2025-2027)
- ‚úÖ Bill dates are recent (October 2025)
- ‚úÖ Calendar numbers are sequential and realistic

**Result:** ‚úÖ PASSED - Bills tab is functional with accurate, current data

---



## TEST #8: Congress Section - Committees Tab ‚úÖ

**Status:** WORKING - Has Data

### Committees Tab:
- ‚úÖ Shows "Showing 40 of 40 committees"

  - "Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress"
- ‚úÖ Filter by chamber functionality

### Data Accuracy Check:
- **Actual U.S. Congress has approximately:**
  - House: ~20 standing committees
  - Senate: ~16 standing committees
  - Plus select/special committees
  - **Total: ~40-45 committees is REASONABLE**

**Result:** ‚úÖ PASSED - Committees tab has realistic data count

---

## üîç CODE INVESTIGATION NEEDED:

**Issue:** Congress Members showing 1043 instead of 535
**Hypothesis:** Query may be pulling from multiple sources or including duplicates

**Next Step:** Check the code for congress members query logic
