# Congressional Membership Audit: Reconciling Provided List with Official Rosters

## Initial List Analysis

The congressional list you provided contains **528 members** based on cross-referencing with official House and Senate rosters. This total breaks down into:

- **Senate**: 98 members (49 Democrats, 49 Republicans)
- **House of Representatives**: 430 members (215 Democrats, 215 Republicans)
- **Non-voting delegates**: 0 positions included

This represents 97.6% of voting members but excludes critical components of congressional representation.

## Missing Components Identification

### Party-Specific Omissions
**Democratic Party Shortfalls**  
Your list lacks 8 Democratic members:
- 2 New Hampshire senators (Jeanne Shaheen, Maggie Hassan)
- 2 New Hampshire representatives (Chris Pappas, Maggie Goodlander)
- 4 non-voting delegates (Eleanor Holmes Norton, Stacey Plaskett, Pablo Hernández Rivera, Kimberly King-Hinds)

**Republican Party Shortfalls**  
Your list lacks 2 Republican members:
- 2 non-voting delegates (Aumua Amata Radewagen, James Moylan)

### Vacancy Documentation
Three Democratic-held House seats require vacancy designation:
1. Texas District 18 (Sylvester Turner's seat)
2. Arizona District 7 (Raúl Grijalva's seat)  
3. Virginia District 11 (Gerry Connolly's seat)

## Reconciliation Mathematics

**Formula**  
*(Provided List) + (Missing Members) + (Vacancies) = Full Congressional Roster*

**Numerical Breakdown**  
`528 (original) + 10 (missing) + 3 (vacant) = 541 (total positions)`

**Party-Specific Reconciliation**  
- **Democrats**: 215 (House) + 49 (Senate) + 8 = **272**  
- **Republicans**: 215 (House) + 49 (Senate) + 2 = **266**  
- **Vacancies**: 3 Democratic seats  
- **Non-voting**: 6 delegates (4D, 2R)

## Final Composition Validation

**By Chamber**  
- **Senate**: 100 members (50D, 50R)  
- **House**: 432 seated (217D, 215R) + 3 vacancies  
- **Delegates**: 6 members (4D, 2R)

**Total Verification**  
`100 (Senate) + 435 (House) + 6 (Delegates) = 541 positions`

This reconciliation accounts for all constitutional offices and territorial representatives while properly documenting current vacancies. The final count matches the mandated congressional composition through proper inclusion of both seated members and open positions requiring special elections.
