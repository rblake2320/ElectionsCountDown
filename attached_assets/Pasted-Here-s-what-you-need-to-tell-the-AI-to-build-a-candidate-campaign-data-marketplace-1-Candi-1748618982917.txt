Here's what you need to tell the AI to build a
  candidate/campaign data marketplace:

  1. Candidate Portal System:
  -- New tables needed:
  campaign_accounts: id, candidate_name, office_seeking, verified_status, subscription_tier
  campaign_access_logs: campaign_id, data_accessed, timestamp, cost
  data_purchases: campaign_id, dataset_type, price, download_date
  polling_results: location, demographic, candidate_preferences, sample_size, margin_error

  2. Revenue & Pricing Model:
  // Subscription tiers:
  - Basic: $99/month - View aggregated state data
  - Pro: $499/month - District-level analytics
  - Enterprise: $2,499/month - Individual user insights (anonymized)
  - Custom: Contact for raw data exports

  3. Data Products for Campaigns:
  - Heat maps of supporter concentration
  - Demographic breakdowns of who's watching their race
  - Engagement metrics (how long people view their info)
  - Comparison data vs opponents
  - Trend analysis over time
  - Voter registration correlation data

  4. Privacy-Compliant Data Collection:
  -- Anonymized data aggregation:
  user_segments: segment_id, criteria, user_count (no individual data)
  polling_responses: anonymous_id, responses, demographics (no PII)
  geographic_clusters: zip_code, interest_level, party_lean

  5. Campaign Dashboard Features:
  // Real-time analytics for campaigns:
  - Live view counts on their election page
  - Demographic breakdown of viewers
  - Questions voters are asking (via search)
  - Sentiment analysis from interactions
  - Competitor comparison metrics

  6. API Access for Campaigns:
  // Authenticated endpoints:
  /api/campaign/analytics/{election_id}
  /api/campaign/demographics/{region}
  /api/campaign/polling/{date_range}
  /api/campaign/export/{dataset}

  7. Value Proposition Tracking:
  -- Track what makes users valuable:
  high_value_users: frequent_visitors, shares_content, influences_others
  user_influence_score: based_on_referrals, engagement, network_size
  predictive_voter_model: likelihood_to_vote, candidate_preference_strength

  8. Monetization Controls:
  // User consent options:
  - Opt-in to share anonymized data
  - Premium ad-free experience
  - Rewards for poll participation
  - Control what data is shareable

  Tell the AI: "Add a candidate portal with tiered access to anonymized user analytics. Users must opt-in to data
  sharing. Create a dashboard showing real-time engagement metrics that campaigns can purchase access to. Ensure
  all data is aggregated and anonymized - no individual user data should be accessible."
