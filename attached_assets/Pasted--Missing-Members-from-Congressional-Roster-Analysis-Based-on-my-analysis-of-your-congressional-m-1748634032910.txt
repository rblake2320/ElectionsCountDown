# Missing Members from Congressional Roster Analysis

Based on my analysis of your congressional member data, there are several significant gaps that prevent it from being a complete roster of the 119th Congress. The 119th United States Congress began on January 3, 2025, and should include 535 voting members plus 6 non-voting delegates, for a total of 541 congressional positions [2][3].

## Complete State Delegations Missing

### New Hampshire Delegation
Your data appears to be missing the entire New Hampshire congressional delegation, which consists of four members [18][19][22]:

- **Jeanne Shaheen** (D) - Senior Senator, serving since 2009
- **Maggie Hassan** (D) - Junior Senator, serving since 2017  
- **Chris Pappas** (D) - House District 1, serving since 2019
- **Maggie Goodlander** (D) - House District 2, took office January 2025

The absence of New Hampshire's delegation represents a complete gap for one of the 50 states [17][18].

## Non-Voting Territorial Delegates

Your roster is missing all six non-voting delegates who represent U.S. territories and the District of Columbia [11][12]. These positions are official members of Congress with floor privileges and committee voting rights, despite not having votes on final legislation [12][15]:

- **Aumua Amata Radewagen** (R) - American Samoa At-Large, serving since 2015
- **Eleanor Holmes Norton** (D) - District of Columbia At-Large, serving since 1991  
- **James Moylan** (R) - Guam At-Large, serving since 2023
- **Kimberly King-Hinds** (R) - Northern Mariana Islands At-Large, took office in 2025
- **Pablo Hernández Rivera** (Popular Democratic/D) - Puerto Rico At-Large, took office in 2025
- **Stacey Plaskett** (D) - U.S. Virgin Islands At-Large, serving since 2015

These six delegates represent over 3.6 million Americans living in territories, with Puerto Rico alone having almost 3.29 million residents [15].

## Current Vacancies and Recent Changes

Your data may not reflect the most current status of several House seats due to recent deaths and special elections [4][8]:

### Current Vacancies
As of May 30, 2025, there are three vacant House seats that should be marked as "(vacant)" [4][8]:

- **Texas District 18** - Sylvester Turner (D) died on March 5, 2025; special election scheduled for November 4, 2025
- **Arizona District 7** - Raúl Grijalva (D) died on March 13, 2025; special election scheduled for September 23, 2025  
- **Virginia District 11** - Gerry Connolly (D) died on May 21, 2025; special election date not yet announced

### Recent Special Elections
Two special elections in Florida filled vacancies in 2025 [4]:

- **Florida District 1** - Jimmy Patronis (R) won special election on April 1, 2025, replacing Matt Gaetz who resigned
- **Florida District 6** - Randy Fine (R) won special election on April 1, 2025, replacing Mike Waltz who resigned to become National Security Advisor

## Expected Congressional Composition

The complete 119th Congress should contain [6][9]:

- **Senate**: 100 members (2 from each of the 50 states)
- **House of Representatives**: 435 seats (currently 432 filled with 3 vacancies)
- **Non-voting Delegates**: 6 territorial and DC representatives
- **Total Expected**: 541 congressional positions

With the current three vacancies, there should be 538 active members plus 3 vacant positions properly marked in a complete roster [8][9].

## Summary of Missing Elements

Your congressional roster is missing at least **10 confirmed members**:

1. **4 New Hampshire delegation members** (2 senators, 2 representatives)
2. **6 non-voting territorial delegates** representing American territories and DC

Additionally, the roster needs updates to reflect **3 current House vacancies** and recent special election results from Florida [4][8]. A truly complete congressional database should account for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories, along with current vacancy status and recent membership changes [2][3][12].
