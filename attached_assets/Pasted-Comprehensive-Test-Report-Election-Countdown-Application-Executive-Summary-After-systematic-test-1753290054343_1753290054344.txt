Comprehensive Test Report - Election Countdown Application

Executive Summary

After systematic testing of every major feature in the Replit Election Countdown application, I have identified 4 critical issues that prevent core functionality from working, along with several minor issues. The application has a solid foundation with working real-time data display and navigation, but key user interactions are broken.

Test Methodology

‚Ä¢
Comprehensive Feature Testing: Tested every navigation link, form, button, and interactive element

‚Ä¢
Real User Workflows: Simulated actual user interactions rather than just API endpoint checks

‚Ä¢
Error Documentation: Captured specific error messages, console logs, and failure points

‚Ä¢
Cross-Feature Testing: Verified data consistency across different sections

Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Fixes

üö® Issue #1: Congressional Search Completely Broken

Location: /congress page
Problem: Search functionality returns "No members found" for existing members
Test Case: Searching for "Nancy Pelosi" returns no results despite her being listed in the member database
Impact: Users cannot find specific congressional members
Root Cause: Search algorithm not properly matching member names
Priority: HIGH

üö® Issue #2: Candidate Comparison Non-Functional

Location: Elections page ‚Üí Compare button
Problem: "Start Comparison" button has no effect
Test Case: Selecting candidates and clicking "Start Comparison" produces no response
Console Errors: 401 Unauthorized, blocked resources
Impact: Core comparison feature completely unusable
Root Cause: API authentication failures and missing error handling
Priority: CRITICAL (This matches the original error you reported)

üö® Issue #3: Global Observatory Page Crash

Location: /global page
Problem: Runtime error crashes entire page
Error Message: A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string
Impact: Entire Global Observatory feature inaccessible
Root Cause: Missing or empty value prop in Select component
Priority: HIGH

üö® Issue #4: API Authentication Problems

Location: Multiple endpoints
Problem: 401 Unauthorized errors preventing data loading
Impact: Affects candidate comparison and other data-dependent features
Root Cause: Authentication token issues or missing credentials
Priority: CRITICAL
