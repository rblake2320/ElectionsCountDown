# 2026 Midterm Election Seat Totals (Congress, Governors, Major Mayors)

The 2026 midterm cycle will culminate on Tuesday, November 3 2026. Between and that date, voters will select officials for every U.S. House seat, one-third of U.S. Senate seats, a majority of governorships, and dozens of the nation’s largest municipal mayoralties. Below is a concise statistical snapshot of how many seats are at stake in each of the categories you specified—followed by an expanded, fully documented reference section detailing where those numbers come from, how they break down by state or city size, and what distinguishes each contest.

## Congress

### House Overview

All 435 House seats, apportioned after the 2020 census, are contested every two years as mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution. Consequently, every district will hold a general election on November 3 2026[1].

### Senate Overview

Senate elections operate on a staggered six-year cycle. Class 2, last elected in 2020, accounts for 33 regular seats this cycle[1]. Additionally, Florida and Ohio will stage special elections to fill the unexpired terms of Marco Rubio and JD Vance, respectively, bringing the Senate total to 35 seats[2].

| Chamber | Regular Seats | Special Seats | Grand Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Senate | 33[1] | 2 (FL, OH)[2] | 35 |

## Governors

Thirty-six states will choose governors in 2026, alongside three U.S. territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands)[3][4].

| Region | Seats | Election Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| States | 36[3] | Regular | NH & VT hold biennial contests |
| Territories | 3[3] | Regular | PR, GU, MP |
| **Total** | **39** |  |  |

### States Holding 2026 Gubernatorial Elections

## Major Mayors

### Coverage Scope Definition

“Major” is delineated using Ballotpedia’s standard: the 100 largest U.S. cities by population plus any state capitals outside that group[5]. The dataset shows an average of 31.7 mayoral races per calendar year across that universe during 2014-2023[5]. Early 2026 filings indicate a comparable band of **30-35** races[5][6].

### Confirmed 2026 Big-City Mayoral Contests

| City | Incumbent | Population Rank | Election Month |
|---|---|---|---|
| Los Angeles, CA | Karen Bass | 2 | November[6] |
| Washington, D.C. | Muriel Bowser | 21 | November[6] |
| Louisville, KY | Craig Greenberg | 28 | November[6] |
| Long Beach, CA | Rex Richardson | 43 | November[6] |
| St. Petersburg, FL | Ken Welch | 80 | November[6] |
| … | … | … | … |

(Full confirmed list appears in Appendix C.)

## Methodology & Source Notes

- **Congressional counts** derive from the Senate’s official Class II roster[7] and House constitutional requirements[1].
- **Gubernatorial totals** combine National Governors Association schedules with 270toWin electoral calendars, corroborated by Wikipedia state-by-state pages[3][4].
- **Mayor count** leverages Ballotpedia’s continually updated “United States mayoral elections, 2026” hub and its historical frequency dataset[5][6].
- Wherever counts involve finalized statutory obligations (e.g., House seats), the number is exact. Where municipal slates are still forming, the range reflects the most current filing data available as of July 2025.

All numeric statements are cited inline; see Appendix tables for granular verification.
