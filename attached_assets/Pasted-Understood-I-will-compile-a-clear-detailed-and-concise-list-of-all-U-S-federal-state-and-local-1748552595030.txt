Understood. I will compile a clear, detailed, and concise list of all U.S. federal, state, and local elections — including special elections — taking place nationwide from now through the next congressional general election. This will include dates, types of elections, and which seats are up for grabs. I’ll return with a structured summary for your review shortly.

Below is a comprehensive, chronological list of U.S. election events from May 29, 2025 through the general elections of November 2026. Elections are grouped by month for clarity. Each entry notes the date, type of election, jurisdiction, and key offices or seats at stake.

* **November 4, 2025 – State Legislative Special Elections:** **Mississippi** holds special elections for **15 state legislative seats** (10 Senate districts and 5 House districts) on Nov 4. These were court-ordered redistricting specials to increase majority-Black districts. (Winners will fill those legislative seats for the remainder of the term.) Other states with legislative vacancies also scheduled many special elections on this date to coincide with the off-year general.

* **November 4, 2025 – Special Election (U.S. House TX-18):** **Texas** holds a **special general election** for **U.S. House Texas District 18** to fill the seat of the late Rep.

* **November 4, 2025 – Mayoral & Local Elections:** Off-year local elections take place in many cities. Notably, **New York City** holds its **mayoral general election** on this date (Mayor Eric Adams is expected to run for re-election, 4-year term). Numerous other major cities – e.g. **Atlanta, GA; Boston, MA; Detroit, MI; Seattle, WA;** and more – also hold mayoral elections or other municipal elections on Nov 4.

* **November 15, 2025 – Mayoral Runoff (New Orleans, LA):** **New Orleans** will hold a **mayoral runoff** election if no candidate won a majority in the October 11 primary. The top two candidates would face off on Nov 15, 2025 to decide the next Mayor of New Orleans.

* ***(Late Nov/Early Dec 2025 – Municipal Runoffs):*** Many cities with November 2025 elections schedule runoff elections a few weeks later if required. For example, **Atlanta, GA** will hold a mayoral runoff in early December 2025 if no candidate achieves a majority on Nov 4 (Atlanta’s system requires a runoff for municipal races). Other local offices in various cities may similarly go to runoff elections in November/December 2025 as needed.

## 2026 Primary Elections (Federal & State)

*(In 2026, primary elections for the November general election are held on varying dates in each state. Below is a chronological schedule of state primaries and runoffs in 2026. Unless otherwise noted, these primaries determine party nominees for U.S. Senate seats (where applicable), U.S. House seats, state gubernatorial and other statewide offices (in states holding them), and state legislative seats.)*&#x20;

* **March 3, 2026 – Primaries (Super Tuesday #1):** **Arkansas, North Carolina, Texas** hold their primary elections for 2026 on this date. *Runoff elections:* Arkansas on March 31, 2026; North Carolina on May 12, 2026; Texas on May 26, 2026 (if no candidate wins a majority in those primaries). Offices: U.S. House (all three states), U.S. Senate in NC (Class 2 seat), and various state offices (Arkansas has no Senate race in 2026; Texas has statewide offices including Railroad Commissioner, etc.).

* **March 10, 2026 – Primaries:** **Mississippi** holds its congressional primary on March 10 (with any necessary runoffs on April 7). *(Mississippi’s state-level offices are on a different cycle – they were elected in 2023 – so this March 2026 primary is mainly for U.S. House and U.S. Senate if applicable. Mississippi’s Class 2 U.S. Senate seat (Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith) is up in 2026.)*

* **March 17, 2026 – Primaries:** **Illinois** holds its statewide primary on March 17. Offices: U.S. House districts, **U.S. Senate** (Class 2 seat – incumbent Sen. Dick Durbin is retiring), and state offices (no governor race in IL in 2026, but other offices like legislature and some statewide executive offices).

* **May 5, 2026 – Primaries:** **Indiana** and **Ohio** hold primaries on May 5. Offices: U.S. House seats and Class 2 U.S. Senate races (Indiana’s Sen. Mike Braun’s seat and Ohio’s Class 2 seat were decided in 2024, so only House and perhaps state offices in 2026; however, note Ohio has a special Senate race – see below under November 2026).

* **May 12, 2026 – Primaries:** **Nebraska** and **West Virginia** hold primaries on May 12. Offices: U.S. House (and U.S. Senate in West Virginia – Sen. Shelley Moore Capito’s Class 2 seat). *(West Virginia’s governor and other state offices align with 2024, so 2026 primary is mainly federal and legislative. Nebraska’s Class 2 Senate seat (Pete Ricketts) is up in 2026.)*

* **May 19, 2026 – Primaries:** A large multi-state primary day. **Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Oregon, Pennsylvania,** and **Alabama** all hold primaries on May 19. Offices: U.S. House in all; U.S. Senate Class 2 races in Georgia (Sen. Jon Ossoff’s seat), Idaho (Sen. Jim Risch), Oregon (Sen. Jeff Merkley), etc.; **Governor** primaries in states like **Georgia** (open seat, as Gov. Brian Kemp is term-limited), **Oregon** (incumbent term-limited in 2026), **West Virginia** (no primary, Gov. Justice term-limited in 2024), **Kentucky** (no governor race in 2026, as it’s on odd-year cycle), etc. *Alabama’s primary has a runoff on June 16, 2026 if needed*. Pennsylvania’s primary includes statewide offices and U.S. House (no Senate race in PA in 2026, as both senators’ seats are on other cycles).

* **May 26, 2026 – Primary Runoff:** **Texas** holds runoff elections for any races from its March 3 primary where no candidate reached a majority (scheduled for May 26). This could include runoffs for U.S. House nominations or state legislative nominations in Texas as necessary.

* **June 2, 2026 – Primaries:** **California, Iowa, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico,** and **South Dakota** hold primaries on June 2. Offices: U.S. House in all; U.S. Senate Class 2 in California (Sen. Alex Padilla’s seat) and Montana (Sen. Steve Daines), etc. **California** and **New Mexico** also have **Governor** primaries (both states’ governors are up in 2026). **New Jersey** holds a primary on this date *for federal races only* (House and U.S. Senate – Sen. Bob Menendez’s Class 1 seat was 2024, but Sen. Cory Booker’s Class 2 seat is up in 2026). **South Dakota** has a June 2 primary with a potential runoff on July 28, 2026 (for any race without a majority).

* **June 9, 2026 – Primaries:** **Maine, Nevada, North Dakota,** and **South Carolina** hold primaries on June 9. Offices: U.S. House in all; U.S. Senate Class 2 in Nevada (Sen. Jacky Rosen) and North Dakota (Sen. Kevin Cramer), etc. **South Carolina** also has a Class 2 Senate race (Sen. Lindsey Graham) and will hold any required primary runoffs on June 23, 2026.

* **June 16, 2026 – Primaries:** **Oklahoma** and **Virginia** hold primaries on June 16. Offices: U.S. House in both; U.S. Senate in Oklahoma (Sen. Markwayne Mullin’s Class 2 seat). (*Virginia has no regularly scheduled statewide offices in 2026 – its primary here is for federal races, e.g. U.S. Senate Class 2 seat of Sen. Mark Warner and U.S. House.*)

* **June 23, 2026 – Primaries:** **New York, Utah,** and **Maryland** hold primaries on June 23. Offices: U.S. House in all; U.S. Senate Class 3 in Utah (Sen. Mike Lee – note Utah’s Senate Class 2 seat was 2022, no Senate race in 2026) and Class 1 in Maryland (no Senate race in MD in 2026; Sen. Ben Cardin’s seat was 2024). New York’s primary includes U.S. House and state legislature (New York has no Senate race in 2026 as Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s seat is Class 1, up in 2024).

* **June 30, 2026 – Primaries:** **Colorado** holds its primary on June 30. Offices: U.S. House and **U.S. Senate** (Sen. John Hickenlooper’s Class 2 seat) are on the ballot, along with state offices (e.g. Colorado’s Governor is up in 2026, open due to term limit).

* **July 28, 2026 – Primary Runoff:** **South Dakota** holds any required primary runoff elections on July 28 (for races from the June 2 SD primary without a majority winner).

* **August 4, 2026 – Primaries:** **Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri,** and **Washington** hold primaries on August 4. Offices: U.S. House in all; **U.S. Senate Class 1** in Arizona (no Senate race in AZ in 2026; Class 3 was 2022 and Class 1 will be 2024), **Class 2** in **Kansas** (Sen. Roger Marshall), **Michigan** (Sen. Gary Peters), **Missouri** (Sen. Josh Hawley), and **Washington** (Sen. Maria Cantwell). Many of these states also have Governor elections in 2026: e.g. **Missouri** and **Washington** will elect new governors (their incumbents are term-limited in 2024, so open races in 2024; no governor race in 2026 for those states), **Michigan** will have a gubernatorial election (Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is term-limited in 2026). *Note:* Arizona’s primary is mainly for U.S. House and down-ballot offices in 2026, since its U.S. Senate seat is not up until the special election in 2028 (Class 1 seat filled by special in 2020/2022).

* **August 6, 2026 – Primaries:** **Tennessee** holds its primary on Thursday, August 6. Offices: U.S. House and **U.S. Senate Class 2** (Sen. Bill Hagerty) in 2026, plus state legislature (TN governor is not up until 2026 as well – note Gov. Bill Lee was re-elected 2022, term-limited 2026, so an open governor race will be on this ballot too).

* **August 8, 2026 – Primary:** **Hawaii** holds its statewide primary on Saturday, August 8. Offices: U.S. House, **U.S. Senate Class 1** (Hawaii has no Senate race in 2026; Class 3 was 2022, Class 1 is 2024), and state offices (Governor was elected 2022, next 2026 – so Governor’s race primary is on this date). Hawaii conducts state primaries on Saturdays.

* **August 11, 2026 – Primaries:** **Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont,** and **Wisconsin** hold primaries on August 11. Offices: U.S. House in all; **U.S. Senate Class 1** in Vermont (Sen. Bernie Sanders’s seat – last elected 2018, up in 2024, so no 2026 Senate race in VT; however Vermont has a gubernatorial election every 2 years, so Gov primary in 2026) and **Class 2** in Wisconsin (Sen. Tammy Baldwin), Minnesota (Sen. Tina Smith), and Connecticut (Sen. Chris Murphy). All four states have governor races in 2026 except Vermont (VT’s governor is elected in 2024 and 2026 due to 2-year terms). Vermont and Minnesota will also have their state legislative elections.

* **August 18, 2026 – Primaries:** **Alaska, Florida,** and **Wyoming** hold primaries on August 18. Offices: U.S. House in all; **U.S. Senate Class 2** in Alaska (Sen. Dan Sullivan), **Florida** (No regular Class 2 race in FL – see special election below), and **Wyoming** (Sen. Cynthia Lummis). **Florida** will have its primary for U.S. House and any state offices (Florida’s governor is up in 2026; Gov. Ron DeSantis is term-limited). **Alaska** and **Wyoming** also have governor elections in 2026 (both incumbent Govs are up for re-election).

* **September 8, 2026 – Primaries:** **New Hampshire** and **Rhode Island** hold primaries on September 8. Offices: U.S. House; **U.S. Senate Class 2** in New Hampshire (Sen. Jeanne Shaheen) and Rhode Island (Sen. Jack Reed). Both NH and RI also have gubernatorial races in 2026 (NH’s governor is elected every 2 years, so yes in 2026; RI’s Gov is 4-year term elected 2022, up in 2026).

* **September 15, 2026 – Primaries:** **Delaware** and **Massachusetts** hold primaries on September 15. Offices: U.S. House; **U.S. Senate Class 2** in Delaware (Sen. Chris Coons) and Massachusetts (Sen. Ed Markey). Both states also have governor elections in 2026 (Delaware’s Gov John Carney is term-limited; Massachusetts’ Gov Maura Healey eligible for re-election). These are among the latest primaries of the cycle.

* \*\*November 3, 2026 – \*\*★**Louisiana Primary (All-Parties):** **Louisiana** does **not** hold a separate earlier primary; instead, Louisiana’s **open “jungle” primary** for 2026 races is on **General Election Day, Nov 3, 2026**, with a **runoff on December 12, 2026** if no candidate wins 50%+ in a race. This applies to **Louisiana’s U.S. House races** (and any applicable U.S. Senate or local races – note: Louisiana has no U.S. Senate race in 2026, since both its senators’ terms end in 2027 and 2031). Essentially, all candidates appear on the Nov 3 ballot; if a runoff is needed (likely for some U.S. House districts or local offices), it will occur on Dec 12, 2026.

## November 3, 2026 – General Election (Federal Offices)

**Election Day 2026** – This is the nationwide **midterm general election** date. Major federal offices on the ballot include:

* **U.S. House of Representatives:** All **435 voting House seats** (districts in every state) will be up for election, as well as 5 of the 6 non-voting Delegate seats (District of Columbia, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands). (Puerto Rico’s Resident Commissioner serves a four-year term, elected in 2024, so PR is *not* electing a delegate in 2026.) Each U.S. House district will elect a Representative for the 120th Congress (2027–2029). *Incumbents and their party affiliations are known as of 2025, but all 435 districts are subject to contest – for instance, at this point there are 13 House Democrats representing districts Trump carried and 3 House Republicans in Harris-carried districts.* Redistricting updates: e.g., **Ohio** will have new congressional district lines in 2026 due to a court-ordered redraw.

* **U.S. Senate:** **35 Senate seats** will be contested in November 2026. This includes the **33 Class 2** Senate seats (regularly scheduled 6-year terms from the 2020 election cycle) plus **2 special Senate elections**:

  * **Class 2 Seats (Regular Elections):** These are Senate seats last up in 2020, now up for full 6-year terms (2027–2033). They span 33 states, including (to name a few) – **Alabama (Sen. Tommy Tuberville), Alaska (Sen. Dan Sullivan), Colorado (Sen. John Hickenlooper), Georgia (Sen. Jon Ossoff), Iowa (Sen. Joni Ernst), Kansas (Sen. Roger Marshall), Maine (Sen. Susan Collins), Massachusetts (Sen. Ed Markey), Michigan (Sen. Gary Peters), Minnesota (Sen. Tina Smith), Montana (Sen. Steve Daines), New Hampshire (Sen. Jeanne Shaheen), New Jersey (Sen. Cory Booker), North Carolina (Sen. Thom Tillis), Oklahoma (Sen. Markwayne Mullin), Oregon (Sen. Jeff Merkley), Rhode Island (Sen. Jack Reed), South Carolina (Sen. Lindsey Graham), Tennessee (Sen. Bill Hagerty), Texas (Sen. John Cornyn), Virginia (Sen. Mark Warner), West Virginia (Sen. Shelley Moore Capito), Wyoming (Sen. Cynthia Lummis)**, and others. (Some incumbents have announced plans: e.g., Sen. **Dick Durbin (D-IL)** is retiring and that seat is open in 2026.) Each contested seat will elect a senator for 2027–2033.
  * **Special Senate Election – Florida:** A **special election in Florida** will be held to fill the remainder of former Sen. **Marco Rubio’s** term. Sen. Rubio (R) was re-elected in 2022 but **resigned on Jan 20, 2025** to become U.S. Secretary of State in the new administration. Florida’s governor appointed **Ashley Moody** as interim senator. This special election will decide who finishes the final two years of Rubio’s term (2027–2029). Moody is running in the special election.
  * **Special Senate Election – Ohio:** A **special election in Ohio** will be held for the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by **J.D. Vance (R)**. Sen. Vance was elected in 2022 but **resigned Jan 10, 2025** to become Vice President of the United States (after the 2024 election). Governor Mike DeWine appointed Lt. Gov. **Jon Husted** to fill the seat in the interim. The 2026 special election will determine who serves the remainder of Vance’s term (which runs until January 2029). Husted is running to finish the term, and former Sen. **Sherrod Brown (D)** – who lost re-election in 2024 – has expressed interest in running for this seat as well.

*(Together, the Senate races in 2026 will determine control of Class 2 seats and fill any vacancies that occurred during the 119th Congress. As of this writing, 33 Class 2 incumbents (21 Republicans and 12 Democrats) and the two appointed senators in FL and OH are the seats at stake.)*

## November 3, 2026 – General Election (State & Local Offices)

In addition to federal offices, the November 3, 2026 midterm general election will include a broad array of **state and local elections** across the country:

* **State Governors:** **36 states** will hold **gubernatorial elections** on Nov 3, 2026, along with **3 U.S. territories**. These 39 governor races involve states that last elected governors in 2022 (midterms) or 2024 (some states with 2-year terms), as well as the remaining territories. For example, states like **Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan,** and **Georgia** (all elected governors in 2022) will elect governors in 2026; states like **New York** and **California** (also 2022) will as well. Notably, many incumbent governors are term-limited or retiring in 2026 (e.g., **Brian Kemp of GA, Gretchen Whitmer of MI, Roy Cooper of NC** are term-limited). In the territories, **Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands,** and **Northern Mariana Islands** are expected to hold governor elections in 2026 (as they align with midterm years), whereas **Puerto Rico** and **American Samoa** will not (their governors are on the presidential-year cycle). Each of these races will decide governors for 4-year terms (except NH and VT, which elect governors to 2-year terms in 2026 as well).

* **State Executive Offices:** Alongside governor races, many states will elect other statewide officials in 2026. For example, **Lieutenant Governor** elections will occur in **10 states** (those that elect Lt. Gov separately), **Attorney General** elections in **30 states, 2 territories, and D.C.**, **Secretary of State** in **26 states**, **State Treasurer** in **27 states**, and **State Auditor/Comptroller** in about **25 states**. These are regular elections for statewide executive positions that coincide with the gubernatorial cycle in many cases (for example, states like Missouri, Montana, etc., will elect new attorneys general, secretaries of state, etc., in 2026).

* **State Legislatures:** **Most state legislative chambers** will be up for election in 2026. In total, **88 state legislative chambers** (houses or senates) across the states and **5 territorial legislative chambers** will hold regularly scheduled elections in 2026. This includes all states that hold legislative elections in even years (which is the vast majority). For instance, **Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas,** and **California** will elect state legislators in 2026 (state house every two years and often state senate either every four years or half every two years). A few exceptions: states that elect legislatures in odd years (like **New Jersey** and **Virginia** already did in 2025) will not have regular legislative elections in 2026. But even those states could have special legislative elections if vacancies arise. By November 2026, we can also expect a handful of **special state legislative elections** on the ballot (vacant seats filled concurrently with the general election). Overall, November 3, 2026 will decide the partisan control of many state legislatures nationwide for the 2027 sessions.

* **Local Elections (November 2026):** Numerous **mayoral and municipal elections** will take place alongside the 2026 general election. Notably, **Los Angeles, CA** will hold its **mayoral election** in 2026 – Mayor Karen Bass is running for re-election to a second term, with a nonpartisan primary expected earlier in the year (likely June 2026) and the runoff/general on Nov 3, 2026. **Washington, D.C.** will elect a **Mayor** in 2026 (Mayor Muriel Bowser’s term ends in Jan 2027), with party primaries in June and the general in November. Other major cities with 2026 mayoral elections include **Houston, TX** (Houston’s mayor is elected in 2023, so next in 2027 – not 2026), **Philadelphia, PA** (next mayoral in 2027), **Chicago, IL** (next in 2027), **San Francisco, CA** (just elected a new mayor in 2024, next 2028), **Oakland, CA** (Mayor Sheng Thao’s term ends 2026), **San Diego, CA** (mayor up in 2026), **Charlotte, NC** (2025), **Louisville, KY** (2026, Mayor Greenberg eligible for re-election), and many others. In fact, dozens of cities and counties will have local officials on the ballot. For example, the list of 2026 mayoral races includes cities such as **Los Angeles**, **Oakland**, **Long Beach (CA)**, **Oklahoma City (OK)**, **Louisville (KY)**, **Indianapolis (IN)**, **Anaheim (CA)**, **Honolulu (HI)**, and more. These local elections will decide mayors, city council members, county officials, school boards, and local ballot measures in jurisdictions nationwide.

* **Territorial & Other Elections:** In November 2026, in addition to governors, U.S. territories will elect their **non-voting U.S. House delegates** (as noted above) and may have legislative or local elections. For example, the **Guam Legislature, Virgin Islands Legislature,** and **Northern Mariana Islands Senate/House** are up in 2026 (as part of the 5 territorial chambers mentioned). Some territories also align local offices with this cycle. **American Samoa** will elect its legislature in 2026 (they have biannual elections for their Fono). **Puerto Rico** will *not* have major elections in 2026 (its general elections are in 2024 and 2028 for governor, legislature, and resident commissioner).

* **Ballot Measures:** Although not specifically requested, note that many states will have **statewide ballot initiatives and referendums** in November 2026, as is common in midterm years. Voters in various states may face propositions on issues such as taxes, voting systems, etc., on the 2026 ballot (the specifics will emerge closer to the election).

Finally, Louisiana’s **runoff elections** from the November 3, 2026 jungle primary (if required) will occur on **December 12, 2026**. This could include runoffs for any U.S. House races in Louisiana where no candidate topped 50% on Nov 3, as well as any local Louisiana offices that needed a second round. By late 2026, the general election cycle will conclude, and the winners will prepare to assume office in 2027, marking the start of the 120th U.S. Congress and new state government terms.
