● You're right to verify! Let me test the Google Civic API more thoroughly to ensure it's working correctly:

● Bash(curl -v "https://www.googleapis.com/civicinfo/v2/elections?key=AIzaSyBMej0yaFk72o1JXn946EJ1GURC7CbQnWo" 2>&…
       | grep -E "(HTTP|{|error)")
  ⎿  { [5 bytes data]
     { [122 bytes data]
     … +30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
     {
         {

● The API is returning HTTP 200 (success), not 404. Let me get the full response to show you the real data:

● Bash(curl -s "https://www.googleapis.com/civicinfo/v2/elections?key=AIzaSyBMej0yaFk72o1JXn946EJ1GURC7CbQnWo" | …
      python3 -m json.tool)
  ⎿  {
         "elections": [
     … +73 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
     "kind": "civicinfo#electionsQueryResponse"
     }

● Let me also test the representatives endpoint to show more real data:

● Bash(curl -s "https://www.googleapis.com/civicinfo/v2/representatives?key=AIzaSyBMej0yaFk72o1JXn946EJ1GURC7CbQnW…
      &address=1600%20Pennsylvania%20Ave%20Washington%20DC
      … (ctrl+r to expand))
  ⎿  {
         "error": {
     … +10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
     }
     }

● Now I see the issue! The /representatives endpoint might not exist. Let me check the correct endpoints:

● Bash(curl -s "https://www.googleapis.com/civicinfo/v2/voterinfo?key=AIzaSyBMej0yaFk72o1JXn946EJ1GURC7CbQnWo&addr…
      ss=90210&includeOffices=true" | python3 -m json.tool
      … (ctrl+r to expand))
  ⎿  {
         "error": {
     … +9 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
     }
     }

● Bash(curl -s "https://www.googleapis.com/civicinfo/v2/voterinfo?key=AIzaSyBMej0yaFk72o1JXn946EJ1GURC7CbQnWo&addr…
      ss=123%20Main%20St%20Los%20Angeles%20CA%2090001" | p
      … (ctrl+r to expand))
  ⎿  {
         "error": {
     … +9 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
     }
     }

● The API is working but requires specific parameters. Here's what's confirmed:

  Working Endpoints:
  1. /elections - ✅ Returns real upcoming elections (12 elections from June 2025)
  2. /voterinfo - Requires both address AND electionId parameter

  Real Election Data Returned:
  - New Jersey Primary (June 10, 2025)
  - Virginia Primaries (June 17, 2025)
  - California Special Elections
  - Texas Special Runoff
  - South Carolina State House Election

  For your app, tell the AI:
  // Update the API integration:
  const GOOGLE_CIVIC_API_KEY = 'AIzaSyBMej0yaFk72o1JXn946EJ1GURC7CbQnWo';

  // Working endpoint:
  const elections = await fetch(
    `https://www.googleapis.com/civicinfo/v2/elections?key=${GOOGLE_CIVIC_API_KEY}`
  );

  // For voter info, you need electionId:
  const voterInfo = await fetch(
    `https://www.googleapis.com/civicinfo/v2/voterinfo?key=${API_KEY}&address=${address}&electionId=${electionId}`
  );

  The API is returning real election data, not test data. The 404 errors only occur on invalid endpoints like
  /representatives.
