Well I think we need to add a version control here.  because I want to have a version that goes up to the next presidential election because I can imagine that if they takes off with people then that is going to be the main go to for information.   but to add to this one and then next we need to have a way to have people to sign up and sign in because if we can track people and their data that would add a whole new element on what we can do. The data tracking on what people are looking into and looking up and how long they are being interested.  Give them a way to add a watch list so they can watch and track elections that matter to them.  so build out whatever is needed to make all this happen. and dont break good working code or remove things    . Version Control & Multi-Election Support:
  - Create separate routes: /presidential-2028 and /midterm-2026
  - Use feature flags or config files to switch between election types
  - Store election metadata (type, date, offices) in a central config
  - Keep core countdown logic reusable across versions

  2. User Authentication System:
  - Implement JWT or session-based auth
  - Create endpoints: /api/auth/signup, /api/auth/signin, /api/auth/logout
  - Store: email, password (hashed), created_at, last_login
  - Add OAuth options (Google/Facebook) for easier signup
  - Include email verification

  3. Database Schema:
  users: id, email, password_hash, created_at, last_login
  user_sessions: id, user_id, session_token, expires_at
  watchlists: id, user_id, election_id, created_at
  user_analytics: id, user_id, page_viewed, time_spent, timestamp
  search_history: id, user_id, search_query, timestamp

  4. Analytics Tracking:
  - Track: page views, time on page, search queries, clicked candidates
  - Use Google Analytics or Mixpanel for basic tracking
  - Store user-specific data in your database
  - Create privacy-compliant tracking (GDPR/CCPA)

  5. Watchlist Feature:
  - Allow users to save specific races/candidates
  - Send notifications for updates (optional)
  - Display watchlist on user dashboard
  - Include quick access from homepage

  6. IMPORTANT - Don't Break Existing Code:
  - Use git branches for new features
  - Test thoroughly before merging
  - Keep existing countdown functionality intact
  - Add new features as separate components
  - Maintain backward compatibility

  7. Additional Considerations:
  - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
  - Implement caching for API calls
  - Create user preferences (notification settings)
  - Add data export for GDPR compliance
  - Include terms of service and privacy policy

  8. API Integration Updates:
  - Cache Congress.gov API responses
  - Add user-specific API call tracking
  - Implement fallback for API failures
