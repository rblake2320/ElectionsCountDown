Absolutely critical! Bot prevention is THE make-or-break feature for campaign data value. Here's what to tell the
   AI:

  Bot Prevention & Human Verification System:

  1. Multi-Layer Bot Detection:

  // Layer 1: Registration
  - Email verification (no disposable emails)
  - Phone verification via SMS
  - CAPTCHA on signup
  - IP reputation check

  // Layer 2: Behavior Analysis
  bot_detection_metrics: {
    mouse_movement_patterns,
    scroll_behavior,
    time_between_clicks,
    form_fill_speed,
    session_duration_variance
  }

  // Layer 3: Device Fingerprinting
  - Browser fingerprint
  - Canvas fingerprinting
  - WebGL parameters
  - Screen resolution patterns

  2. Human Verification Levels:

  -- User trust levels
  user_verification: {
    level_0: 'unverified',      // Just signed up
    level_1: 'email_verified',   // Clicked email link
    level_2: 'phone_verified',   // SMS code confirmed
    level_3: 'behavior_verified', // Normal usage patterns
    level_4: 'id_verified'       // Government ID check
  }

  -- Only Level 2+ data counts for campaigns

  3. Continuous Verification:

  // Real-time checks:
  - Unusual voting patterns (100 clicks/minute)
  - Geographic impossibilities (NYC â†’ LA in 1 hour)
  - Device switching patterns
  - API scraping detection
  - Headless browser detection

  4. Database Schema Updates:

  CREATE TABLE user_verification (
    user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    phone_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    phone_number VARCHAR(20),
    verification_level INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_verified TIMESTAMP,
    risk_score DECIMAL(3,2) -- 0.00 to 1.00
  );

  CREATE TABLE bot_detection_logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID,
    detection_type VARCHAR(50),
    confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2),
    action_taken VARCHAR(50),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
  );

  5. User Incentives for Verification:

  // Gamification:
  - "Verified Voter" badge
  - Early access to results
  - Ad-free experience at Level 2+
  - Influence score for verified users
  - Entry into prize drawings

  6. Campaign Data Quality Assurance:

  // What campaigns see:
  {
    total_interest: 50000,
    verified_humans: 48500,  // 97% real
    bot_filtered: 1500,
    confidence_level: "Very High",
    demographic_data: {
      // Only from verified users
    }
  }

  7. Progressive Enhancement:

  // Don't block users, classify them:
  Level 0: Can view, not counted in analytics
  Level 1: Basic analytics included
  Level 2: Full analytics, demographics counted
  Level 3: Premium features, influence metrics
  Level 4: VIP access, beta features

  8. Third-Party Integrations:

  // Services to integrate:
  - Twilio Verify (SMS)
  - Auth0 (identity management)
  - reCAPTCHA Enterprise
  - Fingerprint.js Pro
  - MaxMind GeoIP2
  - Plaid (ID verification)

  Tell the AI:
  "Implement a multi-layer bot detection system with email and SMS verification. Create user trust levels where
  only verified users (Level 2+) count in campaign analytics. Add behavior tracking, device fingerprinting, and
  continuous verification. Show campaigns the percentage of verified humans in their data. Don't block suspicious
  users - just exclude them from paid analytics data."

  Why This Works:
  - Campaigns get 95%+ human data
  - Users aren't frustrated by over-blocking
  - Bots can't poison the data pool
  - Creates network effects (verified users invite real friends)
