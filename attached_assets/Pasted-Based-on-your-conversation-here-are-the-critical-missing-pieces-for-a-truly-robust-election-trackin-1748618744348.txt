Based on your conversation, here are the critical missing pieces for a truly robust election tracking system:

  1. Version Control & Multi-Election Support:
  - Create route structure: /elections/2026-midterm, /elections/2028-presidential
  - Build a version switcher component
  - Separate config files for each election cycle
  - Database table: election_cycles (id, name, start_date, end_date, type)

  2. Enhanced User Data Collection:
  -- Additional tables needed:
  user_preferences: political_affiliation, interests, notification_settings
  user_demographics: age_range, state, district, registration_status
  interaction_logs: click_events, hover_time, scroll_depth
  engagement_metrics: shares, comments, time_per_session
  non_voter_tracking: reason, last_voted, interest_level

  3. Voter Registration Integration:
  - Connect to state voter registration APIs
  - Track registration deadlines by state
  - Send reminders for registration/voting
  - Store voter registration status

  4. Analytics & Insights:
  // Track these metrics:
  - Which candidates users search most
  - Peak usage times
  - Geographic heat maps of interest
  - Conversion from non-voter to registered
  - Most watched races by demographic

  5. Social Features:
  - Share countdown timers
  - Create election watch parties
  - Discussion forums per race
  - Polls/predictions by users

  6. Data Privacy & Compliance:
  - GDPR/CCPA compliance features
  - Data retention policies
  - User consent management
  - Anonymous tracking options

  7. Additional APIs to integrate:
  - State election offices APIs
  - Voter registration status APIs
  - Campaign finance real-time updates
  - Exit poll data providers

  8. Non-Voter Engagement:
  non_voter_surveys: why_not_voting, barriers, interest_triggers
  engagement_campaigns: targeted_content, success_metrics

  Tell the AI: "Implement version control first, then enhanced analytics tracking, ensuring GDPR compliance
  throughout. Keep all existing functionality intact."
